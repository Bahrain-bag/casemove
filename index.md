## Casemove

Casemove is an open-source desktop application that helps you easily move items out of and into Storage Units in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The app utilizes the Steam-user & Global Offensive libraries to establish a connection with Steam and interact with the Global Offensive game coordinator.


## COMMON QUESTIONS
#### Can I be VAC banned?

No.
The app doesn’t interact with your CSGO game client. It doesn’t inject any code into the game. You don’t even need to have the game installed for the app to run. All the app does is connect to Steam and emulate a CSGO connection.

Furthermore, the libraries [Steam-user](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user) & [Global Offensive](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-globaloffensive) have been used by thousands of people, and this app is merely a cosmetic rendition of these libraries.

#### Does Casemove store any of my information?

No, Casemove doesn’t store any information on your computer. It also doesn’t send any information to anyone outside of Steam.

#### Why can't I just log in using the Steam Web authentication?

In order to move items in and out of Storage Units, the app needs to have an active connection with the CSGO game coordinator. This is not possible when using the web authentication method. 

#### Where can I read more about the safety?

Casemove is comparable to the software "Archi Steam Farm" and since Archi has made a terric wiki on this issue, I'd refer over this wiki for further [reading](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ#security--privacy--vac--bans--tos)

As with anything, It's important to know that the using this software is distributed "as is" and without any warranty.
